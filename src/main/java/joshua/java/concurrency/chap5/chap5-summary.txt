5.5 Synchronizers
a) Defintion
    A synchronizer is any object that coordinates the control flow of threads based on its state.

b) Shared properties
    i) encapsulate state that determines whether threads arriving at the synchronizer should be allowed to pass/forced to wait;
    ii) provide mthods to manipulate the state, and provide methods to wait efficiently for the synchronizer to enter the desired state;

CountDownLatch

5.5.2 FutureTask

5.5.3 Semaphores
